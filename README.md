# Perceptron Neural Network Classification

Classification of flowers - *iris setosa* and *iris versicolor* - by using supervised learning in a Perceptron Neural Network.

> Only used two features were used to train the model - sepal and petal length. The complete dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikrishnan/iris-dataset).
